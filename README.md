A comprehensive monitoring dashboard for Machine Learning models, built with TypeScript, Node.js, Express, and React.

## Project Overview

ML Dashboard is a web application designed to help data scientists and ML engineers monitor, visualize, and manage the performance of machine learning models in production. The project focuses on providing real-time metrics, execution tracking, and performance visualization for ML models in the dental industry.

## Key Features

- **ML Model Registry**: Track and manage different ML models with versioning
- **Execution Monitoring**: Log and monitor model runs with detailed metadata
- **Performance Metrics**: Collect and visualize key performance indicators
- **Real-time Dashboards**: Interactive visualizations of model performance
- **API-First Design**: RESTful API for integration with existing ML pipelines

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript development
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment
- **Express**: Web application framework
- **Jest**: Testing framework

### Frontend (Planned)
- **React**: UI library
- **TypeScript**: For type safety
- **Recharts**: Data visualization library

### Infrastructure (Planned)
- **AWS**: Cloud provider for deployment
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as code
